            <p>as you can tell by... this entire site, i really, <i>really</i> like cats.</p>
            <p>i don't remember exactly when i started to like them. but how could you not?</p>
            <p>here are some reasons why i like them (and why you should too):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>they are extremely adorable</li>
                <li>they are funny and silly and sometimes relatable</li>
                <li>there is such a wide variety that you can't get tired of them</li>
                <li>they are just cats and that's nice!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>in summary: cats are great and i think we should appreciate them.</p>

        <div id="sec2" class="container">
            <h2>MY AMAZING CAT HANZEL</h2>
            <p>and of course, another big reason why i really like cats is because i have a cat myself!</p>
            <img src="media/hanzel.jpg" id="hanzel">
            <p>his name is hanzel and i have had him for 5-ish years! :)</p>
            <p>he's a 5-year old (i got him when he was only 4 months old!) domestic shorthair and he is your typical black cat. he's pretty introverted and hates everybody he's not used to. but he loves pets, toys, and going outside!</p>

            <p>As you can tell by... this entire site, I really, <i>really</i> like cats.</p>
            <p>I don't remember exactly when I started to like them. but how could you not?</p>
            <p>Here are some reasons why I like them (and why you should too):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>they are extremely adorable</li>
                <li>they are funny and silly and sometimes relatable</li>
                <li>there is such a wide variety that you can't get tired of them</li>
                <li>they are just cats and that's nice!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In summary: cats are great and I think we should appreciate them. And this site is just for that purpose!</p>

            <h2>MY AMAZING CAT HANZEL</h2>
            <p> And of course, another big reason why I really like cats is because I have a cat myself!</p>
            <img src="media/hanzel.png" class="hanzel">
            <p>his name is Hanzel!</p>
            <p>He's a 5-year old (i got him when he was only 4 months old!) domestic shorthair and he is your typical black cat.</p>
            <p>He's pretty introverted (he HATES everybody he's not used to) and loves to sleep. but he also loves pets, toys, and going outside!</p>
            <p>He has been in my life for about 5 years and he's made it even better! He is part of my family and I love him very much. :)</p>
            <img src="media/hanzel2.png" class="hanzel">
            <p>Fun fact: I am (sadly) allergic to cats. But after a long time of being around Hanzel, I barely get any allergic reactions around him! Only him specifically, though.</p>
            <p>I'm not sure how this happened, but it's probably because Hanzel is just that great.</p>

            <h2>FUN FACTS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cats' vision are worse than us humans and they cannot see colors as well as them. however, they make this up with their enhanced hearing.</li>
                <li>The oldest cat in all of history was 38 years and 3 days old! according to Google, most cats only live 12-18 years.</li>
                <li>When cats fall, they almost always land on their feet! this is due to a reflex that lets them orient themselves in mid-air.</li>
                <li>Depending on who you ask, there are a total of 45-73 cat breeds in total.</li>
                <li>In 1963, a cat named Felicette was sent to space! She is currently the only cat to have been to outer space.</li>
                <li>In ancient Egypt, when a cat died, its owners would shave off their eyebrows!</li>
            </ul>

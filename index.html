            <p>as you can tell by... this entire site, i really, <i>really</i> like cats.</p>
            <p>i don't remember exactly when i started to like them. but how could you not?</p>
            <p>here are some reasons why i like them (and why you should too):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>they are extremely adorable</li>
                <li>they are funny and silly and sometimes relatable</li>
                <li>there is such a wide variety that you can't get tired of them</li>
                <li>they are just cats!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>in summary: cats are great and i think we should appreciate them.</p>

            <h2>MY AMAZING CAT HANZEL</h2>
            <p>and of course, another big reason why i really like cats is because i have a cat! he is named hanzel and i love him.</p>
